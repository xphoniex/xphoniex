## Work 💼️

I'm an entrepreneurially minded engineer that like to takes ideas from concept to completion.

## Interests 🎲️

Intersection of AI 🤖️ and Games 🎮️ is what I'm particularly interested in. I used to play Poker and Go but nowadays I play Dota 2 occasionally. 

Interestingly, all three mentioned games have been disrupted by breakthoughs in ML in recents years:
- [*Superhuman AI for multiplayer poker*](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/365/6456/885)
- [*Self-taught AI is best yet at strategy game Go*](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature.2017.22858)
- [*Dota 2 with Large Scale Deep Reinforcement Learning*](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.06680)

I've tried replicating the works above in following repos:
- [**Dota 2 Lasthit**](https://github.com/xphoniex/dota2-lasthit)
- [**AlphaZero Quoridor**](https://github.com/xphoniex/alphazero-quoridor)


## Tech stack 💻️

- Node.js with Koa/Express for backend and React for frontend
- Python for general AI/ML as well as occasional server purposes
- Rust for high-performance code
- And others depending on use case
